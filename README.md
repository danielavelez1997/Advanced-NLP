# Advanced-NLP

I took the data from https://huggingface.co/datasets/fancyzhx/amazon_polarity. We optimize the accuracy of binary classification  where DistilBERT is used as a base pretrained model. We applied data augmentation using Synonym Augmenter, Zero-Shot Learning and Data Generation with LLM using ChatGPT 2 prompt.
